# Fetch Data Analyst Exercise

Hey there! Welcome to this repo. Here's a list of the important files to take a look at and their locations:

- Thought Process
  - This is a pdf of my process from start to finish. I don't have very many comments in my R code file since I wrote everything out here.
- Fetch Write Up
  - This pdf is just the email/slack message I would send to the stakeholder.
- Fetch ER
  - The ER diagram in all its glory.
- Raw Code/SQL Query
  - Here's where my SQL lives!
  - I wrote the query based on how I parsed the JSON files. I also exported the tables and saved them in Raw Data as CSVs for your testing pleasure!

Thanks for taking a look! ヾ(^▽^*)))
